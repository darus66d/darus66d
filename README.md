### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello, I'm **Md. Darus Salam** , a Flutter developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional mobile apps using the Flutter framework.

With One years of experience in mobile app development, I have honed my skills in Flutter. I have worked on various projects that have given me the opportunity to develop cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter, integrating APIs, and using third-party libraries.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in mobile app development. Apart from coding, I enjoy to learn different kinds of thing in my sector and using my creativity to design user interfaces that enhance the user experience.

Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories and connect with me if you're looking for a Flutter developer for your project. Let's build some amazing apps together!
